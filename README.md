# ArenaRPG Files

Hey there Kiddos,

Here is the code for the Arena game we worked on in our Java class! It contains the working code for a quick battle between our player and an enemy character. Although the code works, there is still a ton to do! I've left little notes throughout the code that shows hints as to what can be done to improve the code, and I'll even leave another list here that summarizes everything we can do to keep growing! Theres a whole bunch of small tweaks we can do to turn this game from good to great, so don't worry about trying something and breaking the code! I'll keep the master copy up on this page so you guys can just go back and get a fresh copy whenever you need. I hope y'all have a great time exploring!

List of TODOs:
- Let the Enemy choose a class as well, instead of being a basic character
  - (if we do that, we have to make a seperate choice() function so that the AI can randomly select an action!)
- Give the Wizard a few actions like fireball/magic shield/lightning bolt
  - We have to add those actions to the choice() function as well!
  - The wizard should probably have a Wizdom stat to calculate damage
  - Those magic spells should have an advantage to them, so maybe they can't be dodged or they cant be blocked?
- The Rogue needs some love, so perhaps a Dagger attack or a sneak attack!
  - We must edit the choice() function as well!
  - Maybe add a chance to dodge the attack or reduce the damage by half?
  - They should be fast, so maybe they can even attack twice!
- Create new classes! Maybe a knight, or a cleric or even a necromancer!
  - If we do that, we have to edit our class selection at the beginning
  - You have to create a new class file for each new character class you want to add

If you ever get confused, refer back to the Warrior class! It shows how to make new attack actions, new utility actions and how to choose between those actions too! Again, if anything ever breaks, dont be afraid to hop back on here and download a fresh copy to give it another go!
